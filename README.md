# Keras-CoDeepNEAT
[CoDeepNEAT](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.00548) inspired implementation using Keras and Tensorflow as backend.

Experiment discussion and description: [publication](https://www.lume.ufrgs.br/)

## General instructions

Download the repository and import the ``base/kerascodeepneat.py`` file into your Python Script.
This will give you access to the Population and Dataset classes, which are the only necessary classes to run the entire process.

Configuration parameters must be set, as in the examples ``run_cifar10.py`` and ``run_mnist.py`` in [Example Scripts](https://github.com/sbcblab/Keras-CoDeepNEAT/tree/master/example_scripts)

## Example Scripts

- ``run_mnist.py`` describes a sample run using the MNIST dataset.


- ``run_cifar10.py`` describes a sample run using the CIFAR-10 dataset.

## Requirements
- Keras 2.2.5
- Tensorflow 1.13.1.
- Networkx 2.3.
- PyDot 1.4.1
- GraphViz 0.11.1
- SkLearn 0.21.3

Compartibility with other version has not been tested.
